# Redux Server Rendering Guide

I found the [**Server Rendering Recipe**](https://redux.js.org/recipes/server-rendering) is very hard to follow. So I try to make sense of it by creating my own.

## Redux on Server - Basic concept

- create a fresh, new Redux store instance on every request
- optionally dispatch some actions
- pull the state out of store
- and then pass the state along to the client

On the client side, a new Redux store will be created and initialized with the state provided from the server.
Redux's **only** job on the server side is to provide the **initial state** of our app

## Setup

- `app` and `server` are 2 separates project
- the server requires the `bundle.js` file generated by webpack, and it **must** serves from `/static` folder
- the server uses the `app` without the redux `Provider` and `ReactDom` wrappers
- the webpack builds from entry point `client.js` instead of `index.js`

## How to run

- `npx webpack` - build `bundle.js` file and save it into `/static/` folder
- `node ./server/index.js` - then run node.js server as usual
